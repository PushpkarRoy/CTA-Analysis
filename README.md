## 📌 Objective

To perform an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) on telecom customer data and understand:
- Who is churning?
- Why they are churning?
- What services/features influence churn most?

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- 🔸 **Overall Churn Rate**: 26.54%
- 🔸 **Senior Citizens** churn at 41.91%, nearly double that of non-seniors (24.18%)
- 🔸 **Short-tenure customers (1–2 months)** churn at over 60%
- 🔸 **Month-to-month contracts** result in 44% churn, while 2-year contracts see just 2.7%
- 🔸 **Electronic check payment method** users have the highest churn (45.5%)
- 🔸 Customers without **TechSupport, OnlineSecurity**, or **DeviceProtection** are 2–3× more likely to churn
- 🔸 Fiber optic users churn more than DSL users
- 🔸 Streaming services do **not** significantly impact churn prevention
